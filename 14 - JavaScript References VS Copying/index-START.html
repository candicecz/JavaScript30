    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    //////////  4 ways to copy an array  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    // 1. Splice
    const splicePlayers = players.slice()
    splicePlayers[3] = 'Candice'
    // 2. Concat
    const concatPlayers = [].concat(players)
    concatPlayers[3] = 'Candice'
    // 3. Spread Operator
    const spreadPlayers = [...players]
    spreadPlayers[3] = 'Candice'
    // 4. Array.from
    const fromPlayers = Array.from(players)
    fromPlayers[3] = 'Candice'

    //Note: the original array does not replace 'Poppy' with 'Candice'
    console.log('original array:', players)
    console.log('array copies:', splicePlayers, concatPlayers, spreadPlayers, fromPlayers)

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      pets: {
        dogs: 2,
        cats: 3,
        birds: 1
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.


    // Only one level deep
    const assignPerson = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Candice', age: 27 })

    // Using this method will allow for a deep clone though may not be great performance-wise
    const jsonPerson = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    jsonPerson.pets.dogs = 3
    console.log('original object:', person)
    console.log('object copy:', assignPerson)
    console.log('object deep clone using parse and stringify', jsonPerson)

    // React allows for the use of the spread operator to clone an object like so: const spreadPerson =  {...person}
